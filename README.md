# PracticePinballGame
I made this back when I wanted to play a pinball game and thought, hey, I can just make one. Of course, I was still fairly new to developing
things in Unity so it didn't turn out great. I've decided to go back to this because this was my first project I did on my own to break out
of the tutorial learning phase. Although it isn't great, it isn't too bad and it functions as intended in terms of a pinball machine with
no score or really cool table designs.
